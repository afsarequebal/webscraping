Let‚Äôs try to remember that Cryptocurrency was needed. In todays declining market economy we will see this need even more. We saw other countries influence the financial market as they struggled. The whole world is interconnected financially already and was looking for a bridge. Cryptocurrency can eliminate a variety of fees, authorization/transactions, and customer service fees that have burdened small businesses using the credit card system. 
Cryptocurrency also facilitates cross-border transactions and save immigrants hundreds of billions bank fees in an attempt to send money to relatives living in developing countries. Those fees, known as remittances were 7.37% of the amount sent. Which is crazy in a globally interconnected world. Bitcoin payment system charges only 0.005 bitcoin or 1% of the transaction, Litecoin is mere pennies and both offer proof or work.

Channel about me but so much more to say, I will have it in a word document at the start of my videos I guess... 
What the channel is: 
- Weekly videos every weekend 
- Trading is a JOB and NOT a hobby 
- Teaching the importance of stop-loss and trend plays 
- Keeping people on the right side of the trade and not falling victim to fomo 
- Bachelors in Electrical and Computer Engineering 
- I noticed it is free to Like, Comment, and Subscribe for more content! Also, don&#39;t forget to tap the bell icon to be alerted sooner! 
 
What the channel will NOT be: 
- A forum of insults (keep that on reddit and stocktwits) 
- A forum to pump your stock by posting information about another ticker. (comments will be removed and your posts will not be seen by the public until you apologize to me for doing this) 
 
Unlike many youtubers, I will update you when a stock is turning bearish, I will not vanish onto the next ticker so you can follow along!

I want to share with you all my rules and  my practices that have worked very well for me. 

First and foremost, rules; if you do not have rules, or have them written, i HIGHLY suggest writing them down and reading them before every trading session. An optimal trader is a disciplined one.

My rules

1. Do NOT trade while tired
2. No trading in bed
3. Trade only your A+ setups (reversals)
4. Morning routine must be completed
5. NEVER let a winning position go red
6. The trade MUST be planned before entering
7. Market prep (watchlist, plan the day)
8. Use proper risk management/size
9. If you get emotional, take a 1 hour break
10. Do NOT trade chop
11. Do NOT trade during live events/speeches

Now I‚Äôm not going to say that they‚Äôre wrong that might be the case, but I can‚Äôt help but wonder how come most of them were ultra bullish since last year telling everyone that alt season is coming and to keep buying, hodl, laser eyes and diamond hands when crypto market was at the peak?
